# Advanced-Weather-Application
Project: Advanced Weather Report Application This is a Weather Report Application that provides real-time weather information, including a 5-day forecast. It allows users to search for weather by city name or fetch the weather based on their current geolocation.

Key Features:
City Search & Geolocation: Users can input a city name to get weather data or use their device's geolocation to retrieve weather information for their current location.
Weather Details: Displays current weather information such as temperature, description, humidity, and wind speed, with corresponding weather icons.
Dynamic Background: The background image updates based on the weather conditions (clear skies, rain, snow, etc.) and time of day (day or night).
5-Day Forecast: The app shows a 5-day weather forecast with icons and temperatures for each day, offering a more comprehensive view of upcoming weather.
Technologies Used:
HTML: Structures the content of the page (search bar, weather info, forecast).
CSS: Provides styling for a modern and visually appealing design, including smooth transitions, animations, and responsive layouts.
JavaScript: Fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API to dynamically update the weather information, handle geolocation, and display the forecast. It also changes the background image based on weather conditions.
Design & Interactivity:
The UI is clean and centered, with an animated weather info section.
A search bar allows users to search by city, while the app's buttons offer additional interactivity (e.g., scaling effects).
The app’s weather updates and background transitions are smooth, creating an immersive experience with animations for elements like weather details and forecast cards.
This application provides an intuitive, interactive, and visually engaging way to check current and forecasted weather conditions.
